# ðŸ§  Clinical Trials Graph using Neo4j

This project transforms clinical trial data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) into a graph database using Neo4j. It allows you to explore relationships between trials, conditions, interventions, sponsors, and collaborators.

## ðŸ“Š Graph Schema

Each clinical trial becomes a node connected to related entities:

**
(Trial)-[:HAS_CONDITION]->(Condition)
(Trial)-[:HAS_INTERVENTION]->(Intervention)
(Trial)-[:SPONSORED_BY]->(Sponsor)
(Trial)-[:COLLABORATED_BY]->(Collaborator)
